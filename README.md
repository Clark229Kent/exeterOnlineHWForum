## Description

Falling behind at Exeter can be extremely distressing, and reaching out for help can be daunting. 
By creating a platform for student to student and teacher discourse on schoolwork, Exeter Peer Help, we:
make study help more accessible in the internet age
create a database of questions and answers to optimize searching and efficiency

## Installation:
Code is on VSCode.
Database on the MySQL workbench.
Environments that can process JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
Set up XAMPP and php My Admin. Start running MySQL Database and Apache Web Server
No modifications should be made to files/folders on the desktop computer.
We ran into a lot of issues with cacheing - make sure to clear the chrome cache so that older versions of the JS file do not run by accident.

## Features:
Each page can be accessed from the homepage: CreatePostPage, SearchPage, and PostPage.
In CreatePostPage, you can use the function addPost by submitting a form. Just fill in the form space labelled and press submit. Your content will be uploaded to the database through an SQL server and will show up in the website.
From the PostPage, you can use addComment to reply to the original post. addComment works similarly by submitting a form and will upload attached to the original post from the database.
On the PostPage, you can also delete the post. In the top right corner of the post, press the delete button to delete the post from the database and everywhere on the site.
To use the search function, press on the search area in the top middle of the site and search for what you are looking for.
